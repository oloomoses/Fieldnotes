- ADRs - Recording Architectural Decisions: Why? When? What?<br>https://www.beflagrant.com/blog/adrs
<br>:arrow_right: 
I didn't know the term but about 25 years ago I started documenting decisions in my projects.
<br>I named them "why what notes".
<br>Normally one document per project. Consisting of a running number, process, date, decision including reasoning, persons involved in the decision, actions, responsible person further information where relevant and at some point I added tags for better findability.
