# Log calendar week 27 / 2025

My field notes for calendar week 25 and 26 were not cancelled because I was on holiday, but because I was in hospital again.


Sometimes I am asked why I deal with such thematically different topics. Quite simply, I want to hear people's views on a wide variety of topics and learn from them
this is what has brings me personally further and has helped me to understand other people.
