- The EU wants to decrypt your private data by 2030<br>https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/the-eu-wants-to-decrypt-your-private-data-by-2030<br>:arrow_right: I have always been a friend of the EU. The idea has brought us peace and economic success for decades. There are certainly some things to criticise, but for me it was and is one of the most successful measures to secure peace in large parts of Europe. Unfortunately, the forces in the EU also seem to be shifting towards distrusting citizens and seeing them as potential enemies/terrorists. I don't like this development at all.
