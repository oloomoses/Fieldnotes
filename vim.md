## Learning Vim

I learned vim in a way most younger people can't imagine I didn't know any books, youtube wasn't available and I didn't know what a plugin is.
My first vim contact was a remote session from Windows via telnet to a linux machine which I couldn't figure out to quit - no joke.  
Finally I did alt+F4...

But since that time I got hooked, and I didn't regret to learn it. I still use Vim today. I do almost all of my work with it.

> [!NOTE]
> ♨️ If you prefer to learn by video rather than by book then I can recommend the [Vim Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/vim-commands-cheat-sheet/) on Udemy. It certainly took me more years of "learning by doing" to learn what is taught in the course. It's not an affiliate link.

  :set key=
  :w
```

## Troubleshooting

Info: https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/2003/how-do-i-debug-my-vimrc-file

`vim -u NONE -U NONE -N`

Capture ex command output to buffer e.g. `:version`

```
  :redir @m | silent version | redir END
  "mp
```


## RegEx

> **NOTE**: untested :g can possibly be omitted

Add " to the begin of the line -> : instead of / used for better readability  
`:%s:^:":g`  

Add " to the end of the line -> : instead of / used for better readability  
`:%s:$:":g` 


## vimgrep
```
    vimgrep /PATTERN/f % | copen
        vimgrep   - grep for
        /PATTERN/ - PATTERN
        f         - with fuzzy mode
        %         - in current file
        | copen   - open quickfix window for results
```

## Search and replace special chars

- Cursor on char
- typing `ga` to identify what it is
- Use `\%u` pattern to search for the four digits hex e.g. `%s/\%ufb01//gn` to remove fb01



## Folding

- `za` toggle fold under cursor
- `zR` open all folds
- `zM`close all folds

Mapping in vimrc to toggle a fold when cursor is on the fold
```
    nmap <space> zA
````


## Buffer
```
    :buffers
    :Buffers (if fzf plugin is used :BLines to search in buffer)

    jump between last and current buffer
    ctrl+6 or :b#

    alle Buffer schließen, bis auf die die noch nicht gespeichert sind
    :%bd

    Split buffer vertical

## Export diff as html
`vim -d old.txt new.txt -c TOhtml -c "w! diff.html" -c q! -c q! -c q!`

## Macro execution

Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/390174/in-vim-how-do-i-apply-a-macro-to-a-set-of-lines

    Execute the macro stored in register a on lines 5 through 10.
    :5,10norm! @a

    Execute the macro stored in register a on lines 5 through the end of the file.
    :5,$norm! @a

    Execute the macro stored in register a on all lines.
    :%norm! @a

    oder
    :%normal @a

    Execute the macro store in register a on all lines matching pattern.
    :g/pattern/norm! @a

    To execute the macro on visually selected lines, press V and the j or k 
    until the desired region is selected. Then type :norm! @a and observe 
    the that following input line is shown.
    :'<,'>norm! @a





## Creating scripts

`vim -w script.vim`

Additional info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3981535/using-the-w-option-of-vim



## Convert German Umlaute

    conv.vim:
        :%s/Ã¶/ö/g
        :%s/Ã¤/ä/g
        :%s/Ã¼/ü/g
        :%s/ÃŸ/ß/g

    in vimrc
    command! CONV :so d:\vim\vimscripts\conv.vim


## Show defined key mappings

    :help index
    :map
    :verbose map
    
    If you just want to see what mappings you have that are prefixed by a 
    certain key, you can do
    :map <key> 
    to list them all.


## Using Languagetool without plugins

Very very, crude way!

    new | r! java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar d:\apps\LanguageTool-5.1\languagetool-commandline.jar -c utf-8 -d WHITESPACE_RULE,EN_QUOTES -l de-DE


## Python and vim

    Check if Python and Vim are the same bit (64), not mixed!

    Python dependencies and Anaconda on Win OS
    chechk if `pythonhome=c:\Anaconda3` is set

    check if defined in vimrc
    let &pythonthreedll = 'C:\Anaconda3\python36.dll'

    in vim
    :echo has('python3')

    vim --startuptime perf

## Search for a pattern and if found delete to end of line
`:%s/pattern.*//g`

Let pattern be `?utm`:

`:%s/?utm.*$//g`  
- `:%s` replace in whole buffer  
- `?utm.*$` is the search pattern that will match from starting `?utm` up to the end of the line.
- `//` pattern which replace the match in this case it's empty.
- `g` means global, will replace multiple occurences in line. Could be omitted because we replace from pattern start till end of line, but it's my (bad) habit.
 

## Append text to the end of multiple lines

before:

    a
    b
    c

after:

    a TEXT
    b TEXT
    c TEXT

- type `:%norm A TEXT`, this will add TEXT to the end of all lines.

### Prepend and append text to lines in command-line mode

- used `:` insted of `/` for better readability
- lines are marked visually `'<,'>` 

before:

    a
    b
    c

`:'<,'>s:^:before`

after:

    before a
    before b
    before c


before:

    before a
    before b
    before c

`:'<,'>s:$: after:`

after:

    before a after
    before b after
    before c after 


## moving text

### move lines containing PATTERN to top of current buffer.
`g:PATTERN:m0` 

### move lines matching match to another buffer

```
qaq -- to make sure named register a is empty
:g/match/y A -- to yank all matching lines into named register a (capital a to append)
:b2 -- to switch buffer
"ap -- to paste named register a
```


source https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1fmq9c8/comment/loch0vq/


### dt, df, dT, dF -- delete movement
```
   Starting point:
    [,] where cursor is located

    a, b, c[,] d, e

    dt,
    a, b, c[,] e

    df,
    a, b, c[ ]e

    dT,
    a, b,[,] d, e

    dF,
    a, b[,] d, e
 
```

## Simple sum up calculations


Example:

    20
    5
    10
    20
    10
    20

1. Join all lines
```
    20 5 10 20 10 20
```

2. :s: :+:g
```
    20+5+10+20+10+20
```

3. yank line
4. :ctrl-r = ctrl-*

To get floats change e.g. 20 to 20.0. One number is enough!
