- Python dependency management is a dumpster fire  
https://nielscautaerts.xyz/python-dependency-management-is-a-dumpster-fire.html  
:arrow_right: Once developed a small program to ~800 clients with consistent client setup. => deployment by external it support. => script runs out of the box ~450 clients. ~180 clients with libs version conflict. ~120 clients missing at least one lib. ~50 clients which had to be fixed by the outsourced it support caused by different problems. ~3 months ago we had another project written in Golang deployed to ~1000 clients. 997 clients working out of the box. 3 clients didn't work stated by outsourced it support because of hardware issues (not caused or dependend to our program). It was the same client.
